- use Const::Fast on the object so it cannot be altered?

- need a way of invalidating a cache entry, and also passing extra options to
  the MMD constructor -- e.g what if we want collect_pod=>1 and the object is already in the cache?

- document as intended for putting into core later.

- update other plugins to use us:
    [CheckSelfDependency]
    [Test-CheckBreaks]

- future extension - allow swapping out the MMD implementation for a subclass - e.g.
  for Moops scanning, https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/Module-Metadata/issues/16
